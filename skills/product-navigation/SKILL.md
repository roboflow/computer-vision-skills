> **For agents — source-of-truth:** This skill is authored in [`roboflow/computer-vision-skills`](https://github.com/roboflow/computer-vision-skills) and shipped with the Roboflow plugin. If your client has loaded the plugin (you'll see `roboflow:<name>` skills in your available skills list), use those local skills — they're read fresh from disk every session. The same content served as MCP resources at `roboflow://skills/<name>/...` is a fallback for clients without the plugin and may lag this repo. **Don't call `ReadMcpResourceTool` for `roboflow://skills/...` URIs when a local `roboflow:<name>` skill is available.**
